Ever had the problem of secondary screens being too bright when gaming, watching movies or similar, but don't want to turn the screen off?
This is the problem that Dimmer aims to solve.

So how does it do this? Well, basically, it just puts a window on the specified area, with a specified color and transparency. Additionally you will be able to undim it temporarily by either mouse enter or mouse click. The cursor can also be hidden. An dimarea can also be favorited by right clicking the it in the list, it can then be toggled by single clicking the icon in the notification area.

Also note that Dimmer can start at Windows startup by toggling the option in the notification area context menu.
